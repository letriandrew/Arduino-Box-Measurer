<h1>Arduino-Box-Measurer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Mini project to create an Arduino-based project to measure a box. Ultrasonic sensor was used to get the distance and then calculations were made to convert it into centimeters. We will then use the pythagorean theorem to get the second side as we can use the sensor again to obtain the hypotenuse.
